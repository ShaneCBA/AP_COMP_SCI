/**
 * sendfile will create a multipart message with the second
 * block of the message being the given file.<p>
 *
 * This demonstrates how to use the FileDataSource to send
 * a file via mail.<p>
 *
 * usage: <code>java sendfile <i>to from smtp file true|false</i></code>
 * where <i>to</i> and <i>from</i> are the destination and
 * origin email addresses, respectively, and <i>smtp</i>
 * is the hostname of the machine that has smtp server
 * running.  <i>file</i> is the file to send. The next parameter
 * either turns on or turns off debugging during sending.
